When using third-party hosts for external services like hosting databases, you may encounter the option to restrict incoming traffic to your resource from all IPs unless you specifically whitelist an IP address or a range of them.
Outbound traffic that originates from Vercel will never come from a static IP address and so you can't hard code a single or a range of IP addresses.

The recommended solution is to whitelist all IP addresses `(0.0.0.0)` and to take extra measures to ensure that your password is sufficiently complicated. You should also rotate your password frequently to further minimize the risk of comprimised credentials.
