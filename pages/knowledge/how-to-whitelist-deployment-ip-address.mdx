When using third-party services such as databases, you may encounter the option to restrict incoming traffic to your resource to a specific IP address or address range.

Vercel deployments use dynamic IP addresses. As a result, **it is not possible to whitelist a specific IP address or address range to access the resouce**.

## Whitelisting All Addresses

To ensure your Vercel deployment is able to access the resource, you should whitelist all addresses, entering an IP address of `(0.0.0.0)`.

Whilst this may sound concerning, to allow connections from all IP addresses, research has shown that relying on IP whitelisting for security is ineffective and can lead to weak passwords being used.

To properly secure your database, we recommend using a randomly generated password, at least 32 characters in length, and to rotate this password on a regular basis.
